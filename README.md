# Snake-Game
##### At the start of the game each player only takes up one tile, but as the game progresses the players will get longer and longer, like a snake. In order to add body segments to your player, and thus be able to have more pieces to try and make your opponent encounter, you have to gather food objects that are placed on the board. The food will “respawn” in a new random location at some finite number of turns after it is eaten (say 10 turns) unless all six food items are eaten, in which case one will immediately spawn on the next turn.
##### Whenever a player runs over a food item, they will add one segment to their body length. The player directs the movement of the snake by using either the arrow keys or the keys WSAD for up down left and right movements with the body of the snake trailing along after it on each move. Movement is continuous. Once a direction is selected, the player will move in that direction each turn until a new direction is selected.
